### Description

_The Nomad website is being built to create a safe place for freelance creatives of all sorts, to come together! | This is an exercise created for us to practice the process of designing a website. We will exercise strengths in targeting users, creating wireframes, curating navigable prototypes and the best for last, coding a live site!_
