# _THE NOMAD_

#### _MockUp website design for a co-working space. A place to feel at home and welcomed no matter what you do!_

#### By _**Doris Warren**_

### Description

_The Nomad website is being built to create a safe place for freelance creatives of all sorts, to come together! | This is an exercise created for us to practice the process of designing a website. We will exercise strengths in targeting users, creating wireframes, curating navigable prototypes and the best for last, coding a live site!_

### Target Users

* _NOT JUST A COMMUNITY BUT A PLATFORM FOR GROWTH!_

* _A potential beehive that is not restricted to a specific group. Open a nature of all collectives, where everyone is willing to learn and grow together._

* _The design and structure of a co-working space maintains the professionalism of a luxurious office. Along with providing an environment that makes you feel safe enough to bring out that spunk in you. A non-traditional co-working space!_

* _All potential co-workers will be able to see all the cool modern amenities we provide. One of the best luxuries The Nomad provides, are the group activities co-workers will have access to. Ready to mingle?_
